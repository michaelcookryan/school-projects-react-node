# school-projects-react-node
These are a couple examples of work I did with React and Node.

There were three sprints in this project, each with evolving designs, requirements, and extra challenges if we chose to do them.

Sprint 1
Sprint 2
Sprint 3

Each would require a npm install to run.
(Sprint 3 requires npm install in both client and server directories)
